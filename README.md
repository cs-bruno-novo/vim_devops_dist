Turn your vim editor into a coding machine on steroids!
-------------------------------------------------------

Vim is powerful. It has a lot of plugins and customization possibilities. What if you could use a pre-configured vim with all resources you need? What if your config files were organized in a way you can understand and change only what you want?

To install, open a terminal and run:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleyit/devops-vimfiles/master/installer.sh | bash

You need to have curl and git installed, ok?
